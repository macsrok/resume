# Experience

## Senior Software Engineer @ [Beachy](https://www.beachyapp.com) 
### (Miramar Beach, FL | Remote)  July 2020 - Present
Beachy is a startup specializing in Mobile App Based Point of sale.

At Beachy I am responsible for implementing new features, identifying and fixing bugs, and modernizing a mature Ruby on Rails monolith. I played a pivotal role in upgrading the technology stack to Rails 6, introducing and implementing Rails View components, thereby enhancing the system's scalability, performance, and reliability through view level unit testing. My leadership extended to crafting fundamental patterns utilized by the team, empowering them to streamline their development processes. I led the development efforts for pivotal projects such as Beachyâ€™s Simphony Cloud and Infogenesis point of sale integrations, necessitating adept interaction with diverse third-party APIs including REST, SOAP, and OAuth endpoints. Collaborating closely with the product team, I assisted in refining and translating requirements into actionable tickets, ensuring alignment between development and product objectives.

## Senior Software Engineer @ [REIN.ai](https://www.rein.ai)
### (Nashville, TN | Remote)  July 2020 - Present
REIN.ai is an insurtech start-up; its public-facing product is droneinsurance.com.

While at REIN, my responsibilities included full-stack development utilizing a micro-service architecture (Multiple Rails APIs, React Frontend, Redis for inter-service communication). I worked with a small team to build a new admin dashboard to support our existing products. The admin interface development included the consumption of existing APIs and the construction of new ones. This project required that I build a JWT consumer to integrate with our existing authentication mechanisms. In addition to development, I was responsible for deploying the new admin dashboard to our AWS based rancher infrastructure. I was required to dockerize the application as well as build and maintain its CircleCI configurations. I also migrated two of our other applications from outdated docker base images to alpine based ruby images built and maintained by the ruby community. I participated in regular code reviews. I mentored junior developers, and was available to pair with them when they encountered difficulties.
